# NASAMarsHabitatDesign
This design provides a structure that is based on a combination of materials present on Mars including awater mixture covered external structure which is maintained by robotic 3-D printers.  An internal 
structure provides housing for the mission crews.  This internal structure is thermally isolated from the minus 243 degrees F to plus 68 degrees F temperature variations of the surface of Mars by the space 
between the inner and outer “shells” of the structure.  This configuration will also provide protection from radiation, sand storms.  The inner structure will be developed so that breaches in the outer structure will not compromise living and work spaces.
Subsequent designs are being planned for large team habitation are expanded from the above basic structure.  The planned combined work and living habitat will house the following:
 15 living quarters cells
 2 Command spaces
 4 laboratory spaces
 Equipment storage space
 Below surface well area
 Below surface heating and cooling area
Our task is to develop an environmental monitoring system with consoles in the command spaces.  Two consoles will be developed.  These consoles will monitor the following environmental parameters via 
sensors in the associated spaces.
 Temperature – nominal temperature of 72 degrees F. (Except for well spaces which can range from 35 degrees F to 72 degrees F., and heating areas which can be from 72 degrees F to 90 degrees F)
 Humidity – Nominal level of 45% (Except for well which can be from 45% to 75%)
 Oxygen level – Nominal level of 21%
 Pressure – Nominal level of 14.5 psi.
 Smoke detection – binary alarm
 Combined chlorine/methane gas detection – binary with factory presets
 External wall of inner structure nominal 28 degrees F.
 Outside temperature on the planet surface.
Outside temperature will be reported only with no alarms. Internal sensor values and the sensor on the external wall structure will be monitored and reported, 
with color values.  If the variation from the nominal value is more than 2%, the status for that parameter will show a yellow status with the value reported in numeric form.  If the variation is more than 5%, a 
red status will show and the red status will flash two times per second.  If the variation is more than 7%, an alarm will ring synchronized with the flashing light.
Binary status inputs of positive will appear the same as more than 7% variation.The user will have the capability to reset all alarms via a push button.  If however, the sensors still report 
out of range values they will be noted on the console as described above.From the console, the operator will be able to perform the following operations.
 Activate the automated 3-D printing robot to inspect and repair the 
The system to be developed will include a simulation capability for testing the environmental system.  
The simulator will keep a database of event scenarios that specify time of event, event type, location and sensor data values for the event.  For the simulator test capability, a separate simulator test console 
will be required that can, while in test mode, either input events that simulate actual sensor inputs, input and record events to a database, re-run stored event scenarios selected from the database.
